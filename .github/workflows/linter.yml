# Linter Action documentation at https://github.com/marketplace/actions/lint-action

# One thing to note is that this action is currently configured automatically fix and re-push the linted code to the repo on a pull request.
# Because the github token used for authenticating this commit comes from the upstream repo (ie scitokens/scitokens-cpp), those linter changes will not be pushed
# to the fork that is providing the pull request. A manual git fetch will have to be run by the fork after the PR is merged to update the fork to the linted code.
# The linter does not have authorization to lint any code in the repo's .github/workflows/ directory.

# If the linter fails, the PR can still be completed, but none of the linter changes will be made.

on:
  # push: # Can specify more circumstances under which to run the linter. 
  #   branches: # Not specifying input to "branches:" causes the action to run on push for all branches.

    branches:
      - master
  # Trigger the workflow on pull request,
