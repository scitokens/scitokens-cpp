Description: C++ Implementation of the SciTokens Library
 SciTokens provide a token format for distributed authorization
 The tokens are self-describing, can be verified in a distributed fashion
 (no need to contact the issuer to determine if the token is valid).
 This is convenient for a federated environment where several
 otherwise-independent storage endpoints want to delegate trust for
 an issuer for managing a storage allocation.
